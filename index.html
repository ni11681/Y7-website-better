<h1 class="titlec">CRAZY SPACE</h1>

 <h2  class="titlec">This website is about the wonders of space <br>and why we should work to understand and appreciate them.</h2>
 <br><br>
<h2  class="titlec">Why should we learn about space?</h2><br><br>

 <p class="titlec">Throughout history humanity has been enamoured with the cosmos,<br> to us it represent's something mysterious, something more...<br>
 And even now in the the 21st century our universe still holds its secrets and our technology is not yet great enough to uncover them.<br> Inevitably some will say it's useless, that we ignore the problems of our own planet for
 those of the cosmos,<br> but nearly every innovation in technology has been because of our reach into the universe.<br> Think on the space race two countries fighting not with weapons but with minds perhaps even the answer to the heating
 climate lies in humans living abroad...<br> In the vast expanse of the cosmos.</p>

BLACK HOLES 
</h2>
 <br>
 <p class="titlec">
  Black holes are formed when stars collapse after a supernova these only occur when the star is big enough and has enough mass.<br>
  They have a huge amount of matter and are so heavy that they can slow time and stop light. Black holes have three main parts,<br>
  the acretion disk, wich is made up of matter circling the black hole from stars or planets it has eaten,<br>
  the event horizon, the point of no return where nothing can escape not even light & the singularity<br>
  a point so dense and small that the laws of physics as we know them break down.
