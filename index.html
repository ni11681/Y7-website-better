<h1 class="titlec">CRAZY SPACE</h1>

 <h2  class="titlec">This website is about the wonders of space <br>and why we should work to understand and appreciate them.</h2>
 <br><br>
<h2  class="titlec">Why should we learn about space?</h2><br><br>

 <p class="titlec">Throughout history humanity has been enamoured with the cosmos,<br> to us it represent's something mysterious, something more...<br>
 And even now in the the 21st century our universe still holds its secrets and our technology is not yet great enough to uncover them.<br> Inevitably some will say it's useless, that we ignore the problems of our own planet for
 those of the cosmos, but nearly every innovation in technology has been because of our reach into the universe.<br> Think on the space race two countries fighting not with weapons but with minds perhaps even the answer to the heating
 climate lies in humans living abroad...<br> In the vast expanse of the cosmos.</p>
